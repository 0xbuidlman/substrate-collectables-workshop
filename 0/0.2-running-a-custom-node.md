Running a Custom Node
===

Now that you have successfully installed the Substrate framework on your machine, we can quickly spin up a custom Substrate node using pre-configured templates.

In your terminal window, navigate to your working directory and run:

```
substrate-node-new substratekitties <name>
```

Note that we have chosen to name our project `substratekitties` for the purposes of this walkthrough, but you can modify this name for future projects you work on.

> **NOTE**: If you want to peek behind the magic of `substrate-node-new` you can take a look [here](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-up/blob/master/substrate-node-new).

Once your custom node is done compiling, you should be able to run the following command to start the node:

```
cd substratekitties
./target/release/substratekitties --dev
```

If you are successful, you should see blocks being produced.

Using the `--dev` flag tells your node binaries to run a specific chain
