Creating Kitties
===

Now that we have gotten a taste for bonds and accessing runtime storage from our UI, let's actually build some interaction.

## Calling Our Runtime

In the last section we explored the `runtime` variable created by the Substrate UI. Now let's take a look at the `calls` variable:

```
calls.
```

Again, we see that we automatically gain access to all of our modules, including the one we just created. Diving into the `substratekitties` we find:

```
calls.substratekitties.
```

This is a list of all the functions we created in the `decl_module!` macro. Note that our private functions like `_mint()` and `_transfer()` are not here since they are not supposed to be part of our public API.

## Making a Call

So let's try to make a call to create a new kitty. To do that, we can make a `post()` request to our runtime like so:

```javascript
post({
    sender: "5GoKvZWG5ZPYL1WUovuHW3zJBWBP5eT8CbqjdRY4Q6iMaDtZ",
    call: calls.substratekitties.createKitty()
}).tie(console.log)
```

In this sample, the `sender` is the address of one of our accounts. We can retrieve this for any of our accounts in the **Address Book** section of the Substrate UI:

When we submit this in our console, we will see a few things happen in the background, and then our transaction is `finalised` and the number of kitties increases:

## Creating a Transaction Button

Now that we know how to make a call to our runtime, we will want to integrate that into our UX. Again, we will take advantage of components provided to us by the Substrate UI called `TransactionButton` and `SignerBond`.

If you look at the code for the other sections on the page, you will find examples of how to integrate these parts.

The `SignerBond` creates an input field where a person can write the name of the account they want to sign some message. This account gets placed inside of a `bond`.

```javascript
this.account = new Bond;

<SignerBond bond={this.account}/>
```

You can then use this bond to power a `TransactButton`, where we will use the value stored in the bond to power the `sender` field of a transaction:

```javascript
<TransactButton
    content="Create Kitty"
    icon='paw'
    tx={{
        sender: runtime.indices.tryIndex(this.ckaccount),
        call: calls.substratekitties.createKitty()
    }}
/>
```
