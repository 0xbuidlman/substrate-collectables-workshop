# Creating Kitties

Interacting with the new feature



## Bonds

[TODO: Update this section]

The `oo7` library small library providing what might be termed as reactive expressions, Bonds (hence the name). Classes deriving from Bond are expected to be determined when their value has changed and call trigger accordingly.

Remember to refer to the [oo7 API Documentation](https://tomusdrw.github.io/oo7/).

## Creating a New Bond

In the Substrate UI, we can easily create a new bond


## Fun with the UI?

You enjoy building the UI? We have more features in the runtime you could implement, here are some hints how these could be done. 


### Breeding

### Buying

### What else?

Or you have a different idea of what kitties could do? Maybe they want to be feed or fight with one another? Go nuts!
