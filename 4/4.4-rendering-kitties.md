Rendering Kitties
===

If you made it this far, then you have truly earned what we are about to do in this section: Add kitties to our UI.

## Adding Our Custom `KittyCard` Component

We have built a custom React component for showing kitties. It is not so complicated, but for the purposes of this workshop, we will not have you build it. You can download the component as a `.zip` [here](./assets/KittyCards.zip).

To add it, you must place the `KittyCards` folder in your `src` folder:

```
substratekitties-ui
|
+-- src
    |
    +-- src
        |
        +-- KittyCards      <-- Place here
        |
        +-- AccountIdBond.jsx
        |
        +-- ...
```

Then, inside the main `app.jsx` file you need to import this component:

```javascript
import {KittyCards} from './KittyCards';
```

## Fun with the UI?

You enjoy building the UI? We have more features in the runtime you could implement, here are some hints how these could be done. 


### Breeding

### Buying

### What else?

Or you have a different idea what kitties could do? Maybe they want to be feed or fight with one another? Go nuts!
