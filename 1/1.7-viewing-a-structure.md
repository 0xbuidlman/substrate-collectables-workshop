Viewing a Structure
===

Now that we have set up our runtime to make kitties, we should check our work!

We have introduced a custom structure to our chain, and while the Polkadot UI is very good at adapting to our changes, in this situation, we need to give it a hint how to deserialize our structures data.

## Registering a Custom Struct

Fortunately, the Polkadot UI provides us with a very simple way to import custom structures so that the page will be able to decode the information correctly.

In the **Settings** tab, under the **developer** section, there is an input field where you can submit a JSON file. Save the JSON object in the template into a file and submit that file into the Polkadot UI.

Finally press `Save & Reload`.

## Creating a Kitty

Now we can go and create a new kitty. In the **Extrinsics** tab, go to:

```
substratekitties > createKitty(name)
```

Since the name is a bytearray, we need to pass in some valid hex encoded bytes. Type in a value like `0x11` for the name.

Once you press submit, you should see the transaction finalize:

## Viewing a Kitty

Finally, we can go into the **Chain State** tab, and view our stored kitty object. Select:

```
kittyStorage > ownedKitty(AccountId): Kitty
```

and select a user who has called the `createKitty()` function. You should then be able to see the individual properties of the `Kitty` object:
