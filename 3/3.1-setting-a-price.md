Set the Price of a Kitty
===

At this point we have set up the core of a collectables chain, which is simply enabling users to create and own unique items.

But if we want to ...

[TODO: add stuff]

## Updating a Stored Struct

Every `Kitty` object has a `price` attribute that we have set to 0 as default. If we want to update the price of a kitty, we will need to pull down the `Kitty` object, update the price, and push it back into storage.

Remember that Rust expects you to declare a variable as mutable (`mut`) if the value is going to be updated, so we should do that here:

```
let mut object = Self::get_object(object_id);
object.value = new_value;

<Objects<T>>::insert(object_id, object);
```

## Permissioned Functions

Any user can call our `create_kitty()` function with a signed message, but as we create functions which modify objects, we should check that only the appropriate users are making those calls.

This means that we will need to get the `owner` of kitty, and `ensure` that it is the same as the `sender`.

`KittyOwner` stores a mapping to an `Option<T::AccountId>` since a given `Hash` may not point to a generated and owned `Kitty` yet. This means, whenever we fetch the `owner` of a kitty, we need to resolve the possibility that it returns `None`. This could be caused by bad user input or even some sort of problem with our runtime, but checking will help prevent these kinds of problems.

An ownership check for our module will look somthing like this:

```
let owner = match Self::owner_of(object_id) {
    Some(c) => c,
    None => return Err("No owner for this object"),
};

ensure!(owner == sender, "You are not the owner");
```

## Sanity Checks

We are going to start letting users call public functions that our runtime exposes, and that means opportunity for our users to give poor input unintentionally or even malicously.

We need to ensure that our runtime is consistantly doing sanity checks so that we do not allow users to break our chain. If we are creating a function which updates the value of an object, the first thing we better do is make sure the object exists at all.

## Your Turn!

[TODO: Finish this.]
